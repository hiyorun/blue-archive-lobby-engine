# Blue Archive Memorial Lobby Viewer
Welcome there Sensei.

This is a tool to view Blue Archive's Memorial Lobbies via web. Feel free to look around.

### ⚠️ The Live2D's/Spine is a property owned by Nexon/YoStar/MX Studios. That's why I didn't provide those ⚠️
### For educational purposes only! I'm not responsible if Nexon's lawyer are after you if you using these tools for commercial use cases!

## How to use
Put the skel,atlas,and texture map inside the models/{character-name}/{character-name.atlas,skel,png} folder. E.g.

```
models/kazusa_my_beloved/kazusa_my_beloved.atlas
models/kazusa_my_beloved/kazusa_my_beloved.skel
models/kazusa_my_beloved/kazusa_my_beloved.png
```

Maybe I'll add "Import from file" feature in the future.

Also see the `tools/` drectory, it might be useful for you.
